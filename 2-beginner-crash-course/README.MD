## Introduction

Java is a widely-used programming language developed by Sun Microsystems, now owned by Oracle, renowned for its platform independence and extensive capabilities in various application domains. Emphasizing the principles of object-oriented programming, Java provides a robust and secure environment for developing cross-platform applications, from desktop to web and mobile.

With its "write once, run anywhere" philosophy, Java ensures compatibility across different operating systems, making it a popular choice for enterprise-level applications and large-scale systems. It is commonly used with frameworks like Spring and Hibernate for web development and Android for mobile applications. Java's strong memory management and runtime environment, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), contribute to its performance, scalability, and widespread adoption in the tech industry.
